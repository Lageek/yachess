# Yachess: Yet Another Chess (AI)

Yachess is a simple chess AI inspired by this Medium article: [A step-by-step guide to building a simple chess AI](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977).

This project is entirely for fun and learning the basics of AI such as minimax, alpha-beta pruning, etc.
